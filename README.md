# Sibgrapi 2019 Tutorial

This repository contains instructions to perform summarization, fast-forward and hyperlapse on egocentric videos.

### Code and video ###

**Uniform sampling** code, as well as the modified Poleg et al. 2014 Flow Estimator code to run in the Linux system, could be found in the **src** folder. The example video can be downloaded using **wget** as below:

```
wget https://www.verlab.dcc.ufmg.br/repository/hyperlapse/data/video-example/example.mp4
```

### Instructions  ###

For each technique to be applied, a respective instruction can be found. All techniques were applied to our example file, with the **speed-up rate of 5x**.
